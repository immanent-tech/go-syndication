            "content_html": "<p>Aka, Bake Notes for 2024.07.27.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s been rather warm up here in the PNW and I&#39;ve been blowing out my dough quite a bit recently (aka, over fermenting). Which sucks. It&#39;s no good. Very bad. The dough is impossible to handle and the pizza rips easily.</p>\n<p>So for the heck of it, I dropped my usual hydration (70%) down to 62%. I was curious how it would turn out. <a href=\"https://maybepizza.com/calc/?ballCount=6&amp;ballWeight=280&amp;waterPercent=62&amp;saltPercent=2.5&amp;wholeWheatPercent=25&amp;flourNo3=15&amp;oilPercent=0&amp;yeastPercent=0&amp;leavenPercent=2&amp;sugarPercent=0&amp;otherPercent=0&amp;notes=60%25%20Trailblazer%2C%2025%25%20Sequoia%2C%20and%2015%25%20Expresso%20flours%20from%20Cairnspring%20(insp%20from%20The%20Carlson%20Block)\">Here&#39;s the full recipe</a> (where I&#39;m also playing around with the flours used by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/carlsonblock/?hl=en\">The Carlson Block</a>).</p>\n<p>How did it play out? Well, kneading it was a bit like working with Play Doh. 62% might seem like a good amount still, but <a href=\"https://cairnspring.com\">the flour I use</a> generally calls for more water. So with most other flours this would feel like 57%.</p>\n<p>But did it blow out? Nope. Not even close, which was nice. Lowering the hydration that much was a bit drastic though, and I think for my next bake I&#39;m going to bump it up to 66% and see how that goes.</p>\n<p>Pictures of the bakes below, and you can find more on my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maybepizzaco/\">pizza only insta page</a>.</p>\n<center><img src=\"https://maybepizza.com/archives/2024/7/lh_madaria.jpeg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"A Madaria Pizza for Madeline\"  style=\"border: solid black 1px;\" /><br/>\n<span class=\"secondaryTextSmall\">Madeline's bake sans cheese.

What made it even more interesting was how the dough turned out.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of flour right now and I&#39;m trying to use up the last of my <a href=\"https://shepherdsgrain.com/napoletana-00/\">Shepherd&#39;s Grain 00</a>. I&#39;ve also got a ton of <a href=\"https://cairnspring.com/products/sequoia-t85-all-purpose-flour\">Cairnspring Sequoia</a> so I did a 50/50 blend of those two for this bake. These are flours I&#39;ve never used together, and I also pushed up the size of each dough ball to 300 grams. The full recipe is <a href=\"https://maybepizza.com/calc/?ballCount=6&amp;ballWeight=300&amp;waterPercent=65&amp;saltPercent=2.5&amp;flourNo2=50&amp;flourNo3=0&amp;oilPercent=0&amp;yeastPercent=0&amp;leavenPercent=2&amp;sugarPercent=0&amp;otherPercent=0&amp;notes=50%2F50%20Sequoia%20%2F%20SG.%0A\">available on my dough calculator</a>.</p>\n<p>At any rate, it&#39;s my standard sourdough formula, with the hydration down just a little bit because of the warm weather. I made it the day before and let it raise overnight at room temp, then broke it up into individual balls (x6) the next morning and let it raise again for about 8 hours.</p>\n<p>I got my <a href=\"https://us.gozney.com/products/dome\">Dome</a> nice and hot to about 950°, threw the pizza in, and immediately turned down the temp. While 45-60 second bakes can be really fun, I wanted something a bit more controlled and drier than you&#39;d get from a super quick bake. The pizza still cooked in about 2 minutes (I&#39;m guessing here).</p>\n<center><img class=\"bb\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/8/bn_2024.08.17_b.jpeg\" alt=\"\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\"></div></center>\n\n<p>I&#39;m still thinking of this pizza the next day, and I&#39;m certainly going to use this flour combo again. And when I&#39;m out of the SG00 I&#39;ll try using Cairnspring&#39;s Trailblazer, which I also have a ton of.</p>\n<p>The Mozeralla is also local and came from just a bit north of where I live; the folks at <a href=\"https://www.ferndalefarmstead.com\">Ferndale Farmstead</a> make some great stuff.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>I recently bought a <a href=\"https://www.sunmixusa.com/basic-line-sunmix-usa\">new dough mixer</a> (I&#39;ll talk about it in another post), and it’s awesome because I can now make way more dough at once without burning out the motor. But I still can&#39;t bake as much at once — or can I?</p>\n<p>What follows are my notes as I attempt to find the optimal setup for my oven to bake at least six loaves of bread in one go. I&#39;ll start with a lower temp than I usually use (450°F) and then work my way up to 550°F (in 25-degree increments). I usually bake at 495°F in a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZP6ffs\">cast iron combo cooker</a>, which seals in the steam for the first part of the bake. What I’m trying now is quite different, so I expect some subpar bread (at least at first).</p>\n<p>My setup for today includes two rows of 1/2&quot; thick stones, each 6&quot; × 6&quot;, giving me a total of 8 baking stones on each rack. The number of stones isn’t super important, but covering each rack from side to side is. I also have a cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven, which I’ll throw ice cubes into when I start baking.</p>\n<p>I’m baking six regular sourdough loaves, each 700g. I’m using <a href=\"https://shepherdsgrain.com\">Shepherd’s Grain</a> High Gluten (aka &quot;Opus&quot;) flour. It’s good flour, it’s cheap, and I expect to go through a lot of loaves during these tests.</p>\n<p>The oven was preheated to 450°F.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0m:</strong> The loaves, four ice cubes onto the cast iron, and a bit of sprayed water entered the oven.  </li>\n<li><strong>5m:</strong> I sprayed a bit more water onto the oven floor to create steam for expansion.  </li>\n<li><strong>11m:</strong> I used my laser thermometer on the stones and measured them at 350°F and 380°F. I expected a drop in temp, but not this much.  </li>\n<li><strong>12m:</strong> The oven spring on the loaves looks mostly good.  </li>\n<li><strong>15m:</strong> It’s starting to smell like bread in the kitchen.  </li>\n<li><strong>18m:</strong> The stones are still at a low temperature (around 350°F), but the cast iron on the floor is at 450°F. The top-right loaves are cooking faster, so I spun them 180°.  </li>\n<li><strong>22m:</strong> I swapped the top loaves with the bottom, as the top was cooking faster. The stones are still well below 450°F. I sprayed a little more water (probably not helping the temp, not sure why I&#39;m still spraying at this point).  </li>\n<li><strong>30m:</strong> The loaves are still not done, as they need more browning.  </li>\n<li><strong>36m:</strong> I took one loaf out. The top stone is 300°F, and the bottom is 350°F.  </li>\n<li><strong>41m:</strong> I removed all the loaves. One was very burnt on the bottom, but the rest look reasonable. I’m going to keep the oven on to see how long it takes to get back to 450°F.  </li>\n<li><strong>58m:</strong> The oven is back to 450°F, and the stones are reasonably close to that temp as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>Some loaves were burnt on the bottom (I suspect they were on the top-right of the oven), and the oven spring wasn’t exactly what I was hoping for, though some turned out nicely.</p>\n<p>It also took forever to bake, which was a problem. I think the steam and the mass of the loaves made the temperature drop by over 100°F. I’m tempted to jump right to 500°F for my next bake.</p>\n<center><img class=\"bb\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/9/2024.09.28.oven.jpeg\" alt=\"My dirty oven with janky stones\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\">My dirty oven with janky stones</div></center><br/><br/>\n\n<center><img class=\"bb\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/9/2024.09.28.loaves.top.jpeg\" alt=\"\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\"></div></center><br/><br/>\n\n<center><img class=\"bb\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/9/2024.09.28.loaves.bot.jpeg\" alt=\"\"  width=\"660\" /><div style=\"color: #666; padding-top: 2px;\"></div></center><br/><br/>\n\n",

What was different this time?</p>\n<p>Well for one, I lowered the hydration by three points to 70%, and I also brought down the starter percentage to 8%. I also didn&#39;t over ferment the loaves this time, thankfully. I changed the salt, but I don&#39;t think that actually made a difference (though maybe I&#39;ll play around with that in the future).</p>\n<p>I also made changes to the oven layout. I added two more fire bricks to the floor bringing the total up to four. I also have a mini cast iron dutch oven made by Lodge that I put on the floor of the oven. I dumped a bunch of boiling water in it and put the lid on right after the loaves were inserted into the oven. The theory being that it would constantly release a little bit of steam throughout the bake. I didn&#39;t measure it, but I&#39;ll have to in the future.</p>\n<p>One drawback from from adding extra firebricks was it increased the heat up time by about 30 minutes. But it&#39;s worth it because I think they really help stabalize the heat in the oven.</p>\n<p>And finally I pulled out a new utility blade to score the bread. The cuts went much deeper this time and just really flowed through the dough. I wonder how much of my previous problems were because of a dull blade?</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the timeline</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0m</strong> Six loaves, boiling water into the mini cast iron dutch oven which I then covered with it&#39;s lid. Turned the heat down to 520°F from 550°F.</li>\n<li><strong>5m</strong> I added a little bit more steam via spray, which I decided was dumb because there was still water in the mini cast iron. I should have just kept the oven closed.</li>\n<li><strong>7m</strong> I&#39;m seeing some good spring. Was it was the dough or good scoring? Or both?</li>\n<li><strong>13m</strong> Spun the loaves 180° (oh my these look good already).</li>\n<li><strong>16m</strong> Turned the oven down to 500°F because I was worried they were baking too quick.</li>\n<li><strong>19.5m</strong> Four loaves come out of the oven</li>\n<li><strong>20.5m</strong> The last two came out. I pulled off the lid from the mini cast iron and there was still a little bit of water in there.

            "content_html": "<p>I knew as soon as I woke up and saw it that the dough wasn&#39;t going to be ready in time for what my day allowed. It was a very nice day yesterday and I opened the doors and turned off the heat. I also neglected to turn the heat back on when the sun went down so the house was cooler than usual. I obviously need to build a proofing chamber now. And for the bakes, well they&#39;d just have to be under proofed.</p>\n<p>But I did plan on doing something different this time. I wanted to bake two batches of four loaves, eight in total, each at 600g. What could I learn from that?</p>\n<p>Well, first off, the oven was too hot at 550°F for just four loaves of that size. The first batch cooked way too fast even after lowering the temp to 510°F once the loaves were in. And the second batch I dropped down to 490°F for the whole bake, which seemed to help a bit. The lesson learned here was that if I&#39;m going to have the oven that high I need to have more dough in there to soak up all the heat.</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the timeline:</p>\n<h3 id=\"bake-one\">Bake One</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0m</strong> Four loaves in and water added to little pot. Temp dropped to 510°F.</li>\n<li><strong>6m</strong> There doesn&#39;t seem to be enough steam in there and I can tell the dough is hardening, so I gave a couple of loaves a second score.</li>\n<li><strong>11m</strong> Time to spin the loaves 180°.</li>\n<li><strong>16m</strong> Things are not looking good. The spring is super weird and characteristic of it being under fermented.</li>\n<li><strong>18m</strong> Three loaves out.</li>\n<li><strong>19m</strong> All out. This bake was too quick and I&#39;m worried about the insides.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"bake-two\">Bake Two</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0m</strong> Four loaves in and water added to little pot.

            "content_html": "<p>Astute readers might notice that I&#39;ve jumped from &quot;Part 10&quot; to &quot;Part 13&quot;.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve had some bad bakes. One I just kind of f&#39;d up, and another one I used mystery flower (which I do from time to time because I&#39;m not good at labeling things) and it turned out very over proofed. Two loaves went to the compost, but the other four were decent enough to give away. I guess. People always seem happy to receive bread.</p>\n<p>At any rate, with two recent failures under my belt I decided to go back and look at what worked before (+10 points for writing this stuff down) and start from there again. But I&#39;ll change little things anyway.</p>\n<p>So this bake was six 600g loaves, with dried rosemary at 68% hydration. I also decided to not use any malt like I have in the past. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about it, and I think my loaves brown enough without it anyway. <a href=\"http://maybepizza.com/calc/?ballCount=6&amp;ballWeight=600&amp;waterPercent=68&amp;saltPercent=2.5&amp;flourNo2=25&amp;flourNo3=0&amp;oilPercent=0&amp;yeastPercent=0&amp;leavenPercent=6&amp;sugarPercent=0&amp;otherPercent=0&amp;notes=Opus%20%2B%20CS%20sequoia%0A2024.10.20%0ANo%20malt%2C%20going%20to%20add%20the%20salt%20after%20autolyse%0A\">Baker&#39;s percentages available</a>.</p>\n<p>One other thing I did for this bake and which I was doing previously but had not for the past two was to give the dough a 30 minute autolyse before adding the salt. I have mixed feelings about this. I usually use coarse sea salt which takes a bit longer to disovle into the dough, but maybe that wasn&#39;t just good enough for a weak autolyse?</p>\n<p>At any rate, things turned out pretty good today with the exception that the dough could have relaxed a bit more as you&#39;ll see in the pics below. Here&#39;s the timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>0m</strong> Six loaves in the oven at 550F°, 95g water in the mini cast iron cooker. I also completely forgot to spray the loaves with water like I normally do. I ended up spraying extra water into the chamber because of this. I guess this is a natural expiment.</li>\n<li><strong>5m</strong> More spray for steam and turned the oven down to 500F°. I waited longer for the reduced temperature because the last couple of bakes had unsatisfactory spring.  </li>\n<li><strong>13m</strong> Spin the loaves 180° and turned the oven down to 450F°. Looking good.  </li>\n<li><strong>17m</strong> I turned oven off because everything looks pretty decent, but I don&#39;t trust that the inside is completely cooked and I don&#39;t want to burn everything.</li>\n<li><strong>20m</strong> Still looking good. </li>\n<li><strong>23m</strong> All loaves come out.</li>\n</ul>\n<picture>\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.top.jxl\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jxl\" />\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.top.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n    <img src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.top.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" />\n</picture>\n<br/><br/>\n<picture>\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.action.jxl\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jxl\" />\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.action.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n    <img src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.action.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" />\n</picture>\n<br/><br/>\n<picture>\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.bot.jxl\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jxl\" />\n    <source srcset=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.bot.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  type=\"image/jpeg\" />\n    <img src=\"https://maybepizza.com//archives/2024/10/2024.10.21.bot.jpeg\"  width=\"660\"  style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" />\n</picture>\n<br/><br/>\n\n<p>I have some more mystery flour which I might throw into the mixer this evening for tomorrow.

Now, it seems like if you don’t have a 200€ cast iron Dutch oven or an expensive lame or fancy steam oven, your bread is gonna be worthless just because it doesn’t look great. So the realization is that you don’t need to have the best tools, or constantly baby sit your bread, or feel discouraged if it’s not some instagrammable loaf. Bread is bread and what people call “ugly or over fermented” would pass as mindblowingly good 200 years ago.
